## About

Contains a simple Dapp for sending ERC777 tokens.  
Requires a browser with web3 injected, connected to ARTIS sigma1 or tau1.  
The token address needs to be added to the URL, for example: http://lab10-token.dev.lab10.io/sender.html#0xD61C6a101Ca3a817e50a986f6d27f2da0FB21a2c (on tau1).  
Only works for tokens registered in the [ERC820 Registry](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-820).
